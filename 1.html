<h2>1. Why did I make this website?</h2>
  <p><strong>"How can I become a UNIQUE person when there are billions of people living in this world?"</strong> <br>It has always been a question that I've wondered for so long time. And what I realized recently is that <strong><u>it depends on how I brand myself</u></strong>.</p>
  <p>Thanks to technology, we can develop our unique identity through various way and it can be easily and immediately accessed by thousands or millions of people by Internet. However, technology sometimes made it even harder for one to brand his or herself. Since there are so many people using the same platform to brand themselves, we tend to become similar to the one who gets more attention and imitate them, which we can easily see from Instagram or Facebook.<br> I was also one of those who couldn't keep own unique identity in that sort of platforms.</p>
  <img src="1.jpg" width="60%">
  <p>So I decided to make my own platform only for myself, in order to <strong> develop my unique brand and not to be influenced by trend or fashion</strong>. This website is my journey to find my true self. If you visited this website, thanks for joining and supporting my journey!</p>
